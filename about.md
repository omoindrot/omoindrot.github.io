I am **Olivier Moindrot**, a first-year master student in ICME at Stanford (see my [profile](https://profiles.stanford.edu/olivier-moindrot)).
I previously graduated from the Ã‰cole polytechnique in France, where I studied applied mathematics and computer science.

My interest lies in deep learning, mainly in computer vision. I have done an intership at [Reminiz](http://www.reminiz.com) in face recogition.
I have experience coding in TensorFlow, and have been contributing on stackoverflow, see my profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5098368/olivier-moindrot).

For spring quarter 2017, I'm excited to be a **TA for [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu)**: *Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*, taught by Justin Johnson, Serena Yeung and Fei-Fei Li.

I am among the 2017 Schlumberger Innovation Fellows in ICME.
