I am **Olivier Moindrot**, currently working on a new startup in fraud detection called [Fragment](https://fragment.run) with my co-founder [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io).

I previously worked with Guillaume at [MetaMap](https://metamap.com) leading the AI team.
We created and managed a team of 11 people to improve the automation and accuracy of existing systems (document reading, biometrics, identity fraud detection) while developing new features like duplicate fraud detection.

Before that I was an early employee at [Owkin](https://owkin.com), working on medical images as a senior data scientist.

I did my studies at Ã‰cole polytechnique in France, where I studied applied mathematics and computer science, along with a minor in entrepreneurship. I then did a master of science in ICME at Stanford.

A while ago I used to code a lot in TensorFlow, and I was contributing on stackoverflow. You can see my profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5098368/olivier-moindrot).
