I am **Olivier Moindrot**, a second-year master student in ICME at Stanford.
I previously graduated from the Ã‰cole polytechnique in France, where I studied applied mathematics and computer science, along with a minor in entrepreneurship.

My interest lies in deep learning, especially in computer vision. I have done an intership at [Reminiz][reminiz] in face recogition.
I have a lot of experience coding in TensorFlow, and have been contributing on stackoverflow, see my profile [here][stackoverflow].

During spring quarter 2017, I was a TA for [CS231n][cs231n]: *Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*, taught by Justin Johnson, Serena Yeung and Fei-Fei Li. I received a Centennial TA award for my contributions to the class.
To help students quickstart their projects, I also wrote a [quick TensorFlow tutorial][gist] on finetuning VGG over a new dataset, using `tf.contrib.data`.

In fall 2017, I was a TA for [CS131][cs131]: *Computer Vision: Foundations and Applications*, taught by Juan Carlos Niebles and Ranjay Krishna.  
In winter 2018, I am a TA for [CS230][cs230]: *Deep Learning*, a new class taught by Andrew Ng and Kian Katanforoosh.

I am among the 2017 Schlumberger Innovation Fellows in ICME.
