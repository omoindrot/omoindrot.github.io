I am **Olivier Moindrot**, a first-year master student in ICME at Stanford.
I previously graduated from the Ã‰cole polytechnique in France, where I studied applied mathematics and computer science, along with a minor in entrepreneurship.

My interest lies in deep learning, especially in computer vision. I have done an intership at [Reminiz](http://www.reminiz.com) in face recogition.
I have a lot of experience coding in TensorFlow, and have been contributing on stackoverflow, see my profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5098368/olivier-moindrot).

During spring quarter 2017, I was a TA for [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu): *Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*, taught by Justin Johnson, Serena Yeung and Fei-Fei Li. I received a Centennial TA award for my contributions to the class.

In fall 2017, I am currently a TA for [CS131](https://cs131.stanford.edu): *Computer Vision: Foundations and Applications*, taught by 
Juan Carlos Niebles and Ranjay Krishna.

I am among the 2017 Schlumberger Innovation Fellows in ICME.
