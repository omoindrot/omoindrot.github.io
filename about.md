I am **Olivier Moindrot**, currently working on a new startup in human-in-the-loop operations called [Fragment](https://checkfragment.com) with my co-founder [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io).

I previously worked with Guillaume at [MetaMap](https://metamap.com) leading the AI team.
We created and led the AI team to improve the automation and accuracy of existing systems (document reading, biometrics, identity fraud detection). AI alone wasn't enough, and we had 300 human agents working hand in hand with our systems on edge cases or for quality control and review.

Before that I was an early employee at [Owkin](https://owkin.com), working on medical images as a senior data scientist.

I did my studies at Ã‰cole polytechnique in France, where I studied applied mathematics and computer science, along with a minor in entrepreneurship. I then did a master of science in ICME at Stanford.

A while ago I used to code a lot in TensorFlow, and I was contributing on stackoverflow. You can see my profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5098368/olivier-moindrot).
