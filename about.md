I am **Olivier Moindrot**, a first-year master student in ICME at Stanford (see my [profile](https://profiles.stanford.edu/olivier-moindrot)).
I previously graduated from the Ã‰cole polytechnique in France, where I studied applied mathematics and computer science.

I am currently a TA for [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu), taught by Justin Johnson, Serena Yeung and Fei-Fei Li.
